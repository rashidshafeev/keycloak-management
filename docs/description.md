# Keycloak Deployment Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the Keycloak deployment process, detailing the preparation steps and the deployment flow. The deployment is managed through a series of orchestrated steps that ensure a smooth setup of the Keycloak server and its dependencies.

## Deployment Flow

### 1. Preparation Steps
Before deploying Keycloak, the following preparation steps are executed:

- **System Checks**: 
  - Ensure the system meets the requirements (e.g., Python version, Docker installation).
  - Check for necessary commands and dependencies.

- **Environment Setup**:
  - Create necessary directories for installation, configuration, logs, and backups.
  - Install required system packages (e.g., Python, Docker).
  - Configure firewall rules to allow traffic on necessary ports.

- **Docker Setup**:
  - Install Docker if not already present.
  - Create a Docker network for Keycloak.

- **Prompt for Configuration**:
  - If environment variables are missing, prompt the user for required configuration values (e.g., domain, admin email, database credentials).
  - Save the configuration to a `.env` file for future reference.

### 2. Deployment Steps
Once the preparation is complete, the deployment process begins:

- **Deployment Orchestrator**: 
  - The `DeploymentOrchestrator` class manages the sequence of deployment steps.
  - It loads the configuration from the specified file and initializes the necessary components.

- **Deployment Steps**:
  1. **System Preparation**: Validates the environment and checks dependencies.
  2. **Docker Setup**: Configures Docker and pulls necessary images.
  3. **SSL Management**: Manages SSL certificates for secure connections.
  4. **Keycloak Deployment**: Deploys Keycloak and PostgreSQL containers.
  5. **Configuration Management**: Applies Keycloak configurations from YAML templates.
  6. **Monitoring Setup**: Configures monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
  7. **Database Backup**: Sets up backup schedules and retention policies.

### 3. Components Involved
- **deploy.py**: Entry point for the deployment process, handling command-line arguments and invoking the orchestrator.
- **orchestrator.py**: Manages the deployment steps and handles errors and rollbacks.
- **system_checks.py**: Validates system requirements and checks for necessary commands.
- **environment.py**: Manages environment variable loading and user prompts for configuration.

## Conclusion
This document outlines the Keycloak deployment process, providing a clear understanding of the preparation and deployment steps involved. By following this guide, users can ensure a successful setup of the Keycloak server and its dependencies.
